Hello everyone. That's my first repository. It's my first Website which was uploaded on Github. Just open Deployments and you see the link of my Website or tap this https://valentin-kolesnikov.github.io/MyWebsite/


It's still in Russian. I have a plan to translate in English. Now this Website looks like a joke. Quite soon I will remake it.  


5 years ago I studied HTML. I've forgotten this language since then. Now I study HTML and CSS. Soon I am going to try JavaScript  


I wish someone would try my Website and write a feedback about it
